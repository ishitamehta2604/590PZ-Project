# 590PZ-Project
Forks of this are student projects for IS 590PZ

Name of the puzzle:
Kurotto

Built an AI solver for the puzzle using BruteForce and Recursion. It can be run by passing a valid puzzle to the code or choosing one of the grid sizes of existing valid puzzles that are eventually passed to the code and the solver will solve it for you. 

Rules for Kurotto:

Fill in (color) cells with the followingÂ rules.
The number in a circle indicates the sum of the number of continuous black cells extending from it, vertically and horizontally. 
Cells cannot be extended diagonally in any direction.
Cells with circles cannot be colored.



What the project does:

Created an AI solver to solve this intuition intensive puzzle for different sized grids
Generated and Solved the puzzle using BruteForce, Backtracking and Recursion Algorithms
Deterministic Strategies to optimise the code and come to the solution faster
